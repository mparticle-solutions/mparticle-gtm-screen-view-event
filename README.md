## Custom Event and Screen View Templates 
The Screen View template allow for logging of an [mParticle Screen View Event](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/web/screen-tracking/). The mParticle SDK must be initialized prior to either GTM tag firing for the event to be logged appropriately. 

### Steps to enable: 
1. Select the Tag Template from the [Google Community Template Gallery](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/?page=1) or import the .tpl file to your GTM workspace. 
2. Configure the tag including any desired custom attributes or flags. 
3. Configure the tag's trigger. 
4. Deploy the tag.
